# Less Input Delay
This is a **software modification** to Super Smash Bros. Ultimate that removes 1 frame of input
delay.

This is performed by disabling graphical vsync and manually timing the game's core logic to run on
the vsync timer.

Read more about how it works in the [original README](README_orig.md)

# About this Repo

The purpose of this repo is to exist, or more accurately, to not be removed in the future. I will keep the code of this plugin up to date (though I sincerely doubt that another patch is headed our way, ever) and available, just in case the original repository happens to magically disappear.
